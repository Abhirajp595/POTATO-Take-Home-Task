Part 1
Ingest the data: figure out a way to put the data in a structure so that you can query it as described in Part 2.
Part 2
Construct functionality that allows you to query the data. If I search for a term, like “music,” I would like to know some subset of the following:
How many tweets were posted containing the term on each day?
How many unique users posted a tweet containing the term?
How many likes did tweets containing the term get, on average?
Where (in terms of place IDs) did the tweets come from?
What times of day were the tweets posted at? 
Which user posted the most tweets containing the term?
